            "answer": "The chapter argues that a more nuanced definition of accountability is needed to permit responsible innovation of climate technologies that align with sustainable development. It starts by describing climate engineering and using carbon capture, usage, and storage (CCUS) as a use case. Then, it explores how the responsible deployment of climate engineering innovation and the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) targets should be managed, taking into account political preferences and social acceptability, and how normative justifications and decisions about innovation and sustainable strategies and constraints are made and communicated. Finally, the chapter discusses what accountability is, how it has been traditionally understood, and why a more expansive and polysemic definition is required for climate engineering technologies to support sustainable development."

            "question": "What are the criticisms raised against technologies like carbon capture and storage as solutions to climate change?",
            "answer": "Critics argue that these technologies are morally problematic \"techno-fixes\" because they only address the symptoms of climate change and do not tackle the underlying social, political, and economic dynamics that contribute to climate-unfriendly behaviors. Their long-term consequences and broader impacts on shifting paradigms towards more sustainable practices are still unknown. (Sources: Smith, 2012; Jones, 2012)"

            "question": "What are the main criticisms against climate engineering technologies like Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS)?",
            "answer": "Critics argue that CCUS technologies are often embedded in undemocratic systems of innovation and knowledge, disregard the underlying causes and patterns of climate change, and increase the dependence of developing countries and vulnerable groups while strengthening the power and control of developed countries and technocratic, corporate elites. The most debated issue is the exacerbation of power asymmetries and the potential for generating profound and global relations of domination. (Sources: [2020], [Smith, 2018, 2021])"

            "question": "Why is democratic and effective governance crucial for achieving the SDGs and developing technologies like CCUS responsibly?",
            "answer": "Democratic and effective governance mechanisms are considered the fourth pillar of sustainable development (Kanie et al., 2014), as they are essential for achieving the SDGs and developing technologies like CCUS responsibly. Neglecting governance frameworks and democratic processes can result in separated and self-referential activities without appropriate citizen engagement (Bellamy et al., 2021; Stahl et al., 2021). These governance structures provide a platform for ongoing debate and deliberation about the normative ends of innovation and its governance. Without them, technologies may not be developed and sustained responsibly."

            "question": "Why is there a lack of consensus on the theoretical foundation of governance for sustainable development, and how do empirical studies describe the impact of SDG policies on this issue?",
            "answer": "The theoretical foundation of governance for sustainable development remains unclear, and there is no agreement among scholars on this topic. Empirical studies have shown that policies aimed at achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) can lead to a situation of \"anti-politics,\" where trade-offs and political assumptions are obscured and cannot be contested, particularly with regard to dominant private, market-based organizations. This hinders meaningful discussions and potential solutions to incoherencies within these structures. (Yunita et al., 2022;, 2019)"

            "question": "How are the design and deployment of sustainable development trajectories influenced by political considerations and power structures, particularly regarding climate engineering innovations?",
            "answer": "The design and deployment of sustainable development trajectories are not solely technical matters but are deeply entangled with broader socio-political contexts and power structures. Critics argue that the SDGs can compromise public decision-making mechanisms and privilege commercial interests, potentially leading to unjust and exclusionary policies. The choice of climate engineering innovations also depends on political preferences and social acceptability, and sustainability constraints must be managed by governments. Climate engineering innovation processes themselves are political due to their connection to these larger socio-political contexts and power structures.

            "question": "Why is it important to examine the political normative frameworks of legitimacy, responsibility, and accountability in relation to sustainable development goals (SDGs)?",
            "answer": "According to recent scholarly studies, examining the political normative frameworks of legitimacy, responsibility, and accountability is crucial for understanding the long-term political decisions, interactions, and structures related to SDGs. This is because effective implementation and achievement of SDGs targets require robust governance methods that prioritize inclusion, empowerment, and transparency. These frameworks can help scrutinize the normative qualities of governance and uncover the political rationale behind the transformative potential of the 2030 Agenda."

Traditional political theory, however, highlights the self-determination of citizens maintaining their representatives accountable and responsive (, 2010)."

            "question": "What are the requirements for responsiveness in political studies, and how does it relate to meaningful forms of citizen participation?",
            "answer": "Responsiveness refers to the potential readiness of political entities to respond to citizens, who hold ultimate responsibility for actions and decisions. Citizens require meaningful forms of participation, which offer opportunities for real influence in the polity. However, responsiveness may conflict with political equality and influence in civic life due to economic standing or socio-political resources and powers that make certain individuals or groups more likely to voice concerns and shape policy strategies and outcomes.

            "question": "What steps should be taken to ensure the responsible implementation of carbon capture, usage, and storage (CCUS) technologies and their contribution to sustainable development?",
            "answer": "To ensure the responsible implementation of CCUS technologies and their contribution to sustainable development, it's crucial to recognize the socio-political issues they pose and avoid an apolitical facade. A theoretically informed account of accountability can provide a basis for reflection and help build a dynamic landscape for the innovation of these technologies. This approach will prevent the adoption of an illusory techno-optimism and foster effective governance arrangements for managing the complex tech-mediated climate model."

        {
            "question": "What are the reasons for examining climate engineering innovation through a socio-political lens?",
            "answer": "Climate engineering innovation carries potential consequences for power imbalances and inequality, necessitating regulatory frameworks, enforcement mechanisms, and ethical justifications for innovation and sustainability choices. It also provides instances of injustice and sets precedents. Thus, socio-political analysis is essential for understanding its implications."

            "question": "What steps are being taken to promote the implementation of carbon dioxide removal and storage strategies, and what role does accountability play in this process?",
            "answer": "The implementation of carbon dioxide removal and storage strategies into national mitigation portfolios is still low, and public awareness of these strategies needs improvement. Accountability plays a significant role in this process, as shown in the 2015 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) under targets 16.6, 17, 5, and 10. The European Union's Horizon 2020 project (Grant Agreement no. 101006249) aims to provide \"ethics by design\" guidelines and legal recommendations for climate engineering technologies to ensure responsible innovation and sustainable development."
