            "question": "Why is it challenging for many countries to regularly collect data for monitoring progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)?",
            "answer": "Due to the expense and requirement of adequate statistical capacity, many countries go decades without making ground measurements on key SDG indicators. As a result, only about half of these indicators have regular data from more than half of the world's countries.

            "answer": "The study uses PCA to summarize survey data into a single scalar asset wealth index per cluster, which represents a local community or village. This index is referred to as cluster-level wealth. Previously, researchers have found that widely-available imagery sources such as satellite imagery and crowd-sourced street-level imagery can effectively predict cluster-level asset wealth when used as inputs in deep learning models. Specifically, there are two regression tasks for poverty prediction at the cluster level, both utilizing imagery inputs to estimate the asset wealth index. These tasks aim to identify the presence or absence of poverty based on the estimated wealth index. Therefore, the study combines the PCA approach with imagery inputs from various sources to predict and analyze cluster-level asset wealth and poverty."

It serves as an alternative to traditional farm surveys for calculating indicators related to SDG 2, specifically the proportion of agricultural area under productive and sustainable agriculture. Although some datasets for cropland mapping might have weak labels, they still offer significant advantages over farm surveys in terms of coverage, frequency, and cost."

While cropland mapping is relatively straightforward in areas with abundant labels, there is a pressing need to develop efficient methods for generating georeferenced labels and accurately mapping cropland in such low-resource regions. To address this challenge, a new dataset for performing weakly supervised cropland classification in the U.S. using unpublished data from [102] is being released. This dataset aims to contribute towards advancing research in this area."

This is particularly important given the challenges associated with accurately mapping cropland in low-resource regions, where ground labels are scarce and existing datasets have significant errors. By working with this dataset, researchers can help advance the field and potentially develop more effective methods for cropland mapping in under-resourced areas around the world."

Higher educational attainment in women is also strongly associated with enhanced child nutrition and reduced child mortality. Previous studies have shown that deep learning techniques can accurately predict educational attainment using satellite and street-level images. In this study, we present the average years of educational attainment for women of reproductive age (15-49), obtained from the same surveys utilized for creating the asset wealth labels in the poverty prediction task."

            "answer": "The relationship between access to improved sanitation and clean water and lower child mortality rates is well-established, with studies showing a correlation between the two [65, 33]. In the given context, researchers provided cluster-level average years of a water quality index and sanitation index, which were computed from satellite and street-level imagery for 2,105,026 households across 49 countries. These labels, numbering 87,938 for the water index and 89,271 for the sanitation index, were derived from the same surveys used for creating asset wealth labels in the poverty prediction task. Models were then evaluated using the r2metric on labels from held-out test countries. This approach allowed for an analysis of the impact of water quality and sanitation on child mortality rates at a larger scale."

This information could contribute to studies aimed at understanding the impact of environmental factors, including those related to climate change and industrial processes like brick manufacturing, on child health outcomes. SDG 13 focuses on combatting climate change and its economic and livelihood disruptions, and monitoring emissions and environmental regulatory compliance are crucial steps towards achieving this goal. In the context of South Asia, where brick manufacturing is a significant contributor to carbon emissions and air pollution, analyzing the relationship between these environmental factors and child mortality rates could provide valuable insights into the complex interplay between environmental degradation and public health. Additionally, understanding these relationships may help inform policy decisions and interventions aimed at improving both environmental sustainability and child health outcomes."

Indicators related to gender equality (SDG 5) and access to affordable and clean energy (SDG 7) already exist in the surveys used to create labels for SUSTAIN BENCH tasks. However, these indicators will require additional processing before being released. Specifically, field surveys for these indicators are costly, and labeling images for model training requires significant manual effort by experts, limiting the quantities available. Therefore, the indicators will need to undergo additional processing before they can be added to the dataset. This may involve cleaning and preprocessing the data, as well as ensuring that it meets the necessary standards for inclusion in the dataset. Once this processing is complete, the new indicators can be added to the SUSTAIN BENCH dataset."
