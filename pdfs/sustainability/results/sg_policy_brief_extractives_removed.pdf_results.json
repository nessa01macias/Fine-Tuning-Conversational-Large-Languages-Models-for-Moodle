            "question": "How do some industries impact the job market and safety conditions for workers, and what role do foreign multinationals play?",
            "answer": "Some industries, particularly extractive ones, may provide limited jobs for local communities due to their technology-intensive nature and foreign ownership. These jobs often come with outdated infrastructure, inadequate safety regulations implementation, and insufficient personal protective equipment, putting workers at risk. In other cases, mine or production sites serve as the sole sources of jobs and income for entire towns or regions, making them heavily dependent on their existence."

            "question": "How do extractive industries affect the rights of indigenous peoples?",
            "answer": "Extractive industries have been identified as the most pervasive source of challenges to the full exercise of indigenous peoples' rights. Land loss, destruction of cultural sites, marginalization, systematic discrimination, and pollution impacts have resulted in loss of lives, health, livelihoods, identities, and cultures. Human rights defenders, including land and environmental defenders, are especially vulnerable to death and harassment."

            "question": "What are some environmental challenges facing the extractive industries, and how do these impacts extend globally?",
            "answer": "Extractive industries pose significant environmental challenges at both the local and global levels, including water, air, and soil contamination from extraction, smelting, and transportation processes, water use competition, destruction of habitat and protected areas, and a loss of biodiversity. The sector is responsible for 73% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions, making it a major contributor to climate change. Eliminating fossil fuel subsidies and adopting efficient fossil fuel pricing could have lowered global carbon emissions by 28%, increased tax revenues by 3.8% of global GDP, and contributed to net economic benefits of 1.7% of global GDP in 2015. Weak legislation and law enforcement exacerbate these negative environmental impacts, particularly in the case of informal"

            "question": "How much has been committed to the fossil fuel sector and fossil fuel-dependent industries in the G20 countries through recovery stimulus packages, and what is the situation with clean energy commitments?",
            "answer": "278 billion has been committed to the fossil fuel sector and fossil fuel-dependent industries in the G20 countries, mostly unconditionally. By contrast, 241 billion has been committed to clean energy, but only 25% of that sum has been given as unconditional support. The acceleration of the green transition is expected to increase demand for metals and other critical rare earths, and electric vehicle sales have increased by more than 30% every year in the last decade. The sharp and continued fall in renewable energy costs have made investing in clean energy sources particularly attractive, as evidenced by Saudi Arabia's second PV tender drawing a world record bid of 2.73 cents"

            "answer": "The Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI) should be expanded to include vulnerable middle-income countries, and a long-term Debt Swap Mechanism (DSM) should be operationalized to facilitate debt-for-climate and nature swaps. Additionally, state-contingent instruments, such as income-linked bonds, should be integrated. Multilateral development banks (MDBs) should increase spending on green and inclusive recovery projects."

            "question": "How can advanced economies use SDRs to support commodity-dependent countries and promote sustainable initiatives?",
            "answer": "Advanced economies could grant a proportion of their unused SDRs to commodity-dependent countries and use the remaining SDRs to invest in sustainable and green initiatives in lower-income economies. Additionally, fiscal recovery packages could provide targeted support for transforming the sector, such as investing in renewables and sustainable infrastructure, while making fiscal regimes more progressive and transparent to avoid tax breaks on profits and incentives that cause a race to the bottom."
