            "question": "What are the environmental costs of information and communications technology (ICT), and why is AI often seen as a solution despite these costs?",
            "answer": "ICT is responsible for 5-9% of global electricity use and around 3% of gas emissions. Studies show that ICT power consumption will continue to grow due to increasing use and production of consumer devices, network demand, data centers, and crypto assets. However, ICT systems are often seen as the key technology to solve contemporary challenges, including the environmental crisis, despite these environmental costs. Further tensions will emerge in relation to electronic waste and the environmental footprints of digital technologies. (Source: p. 2-3, 2022)"

            "question": "How is the pandemic affecting greenhouse gas emissions despite the decline in transportation and industrial activity?",
            "answer": "Despite the decline in transportation and industrial activity during the pandemic, greenhouse gas emissions have remained high due to constant electricity consumption, which is largely derived from fossil fuels. Global electricity energy mix comprises 64% fossil fuels, making it the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions. Without fundamental shifts to renewable resources in the global energy production, it will be challenging to prevent incalculable loss of life. Additionally, the tech industry's carbon footprint is projected to increase to 14% by 2040, with data centers contributing 45% and network infrastructure 24%. More research is needed to understand the environmental toll of AI, a communication technology deeply reliant on data and energy."

            "question": "What is the Ecomodernist perspective on climate mitigation and how does it differ from other views?",
            "answer": "The Ecomodernist perspective argues that climate mitigation is a technological challenge and encourages limitless economic growth. They believe that advancements in renewable energy will lead to abundant distributed energy, rather than a need to consume less. This differs from other perspectives that place the unequal capitalist power relations at the center of the climate emergency and advocate for reducing energy consumption or downsizing life. Despite its focus on limiting greenhouse gas emissions, the International Monetary Fund has encouraged technological improvement in energy efficiency as a way of averting environmental disaster, which some argue is an apology for the status quo embraced by corporate giants."

            "question": "How does the production of AI technology contribute to environmental costs and overlooked sustainability goals, according to the text?",
            "answer": "The text discusses how the production of AI technology requires the extraction of rare metals and mineral sources, following logics of colonialism, and overlooks social and environmental justice. This goes against sustainability goals such as SDG 12 (responsible consumption), SDG 13 (climate action), SDG 15 (life on land), and SDG 7 (clean energy), as well as more generic sustainability goals. The concept of \"technocolonialism\" is introduced to analyze how digital developments converge with humanitarian structures and market forces, reinvigorating and reworking colonial legacies."
