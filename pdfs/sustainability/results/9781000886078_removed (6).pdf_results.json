        },
        {
            "question": "Why is technological solutionism a concern for achieving the SDGs by 2030?",
            "answer": "Technological solutionism, which foregrounds the problem-solving capabilities of human innovation and advances capital and energy-intensive projects, is a concern for achieving the SDGs by 2030 because it may not be on our side due to its potential for creating unsustainable solutions and perpetuating unsustainable practices."
        },
        {
            "question": "Why does the belief in tech-solutionism persist strongly in education and sustainable development discussions, particularly in relation to SDG 4?",
            "answer": "The persistence of tech-solutionism in education and sustainable development discussions can be attributed to the charismatic nature of new technologies. The promise of impressive technical progress is often associated with equally far-reaching social progress, making new technologies gain traction in education discussions."

            "question": "How does the implementation of new digital technologies lead to tautological conclusions and alter the perception of sustainability in education?",
            "answer": "The use of digital technology can lead to tautological conclusions by offering it as a solution to problems caused by previous digital technology. It also has a tendency to economize and depoliticize environmental issues, fundamentally altering how sustainability in education is perceived. This raises concerns about the continued pursuit of reductionist forms of solutionist thinking in relation to sustainable development and SDG 4."
        },
        {
            "question": "How might digital education developments impact the complex social nature of sustainability problems?",
            "answer": "It is possible that digital education developments may not effectively address sustainability problems as promised, and instead might even perpetuate or intensify sustainability harms. The implementation of virtual schooling during pandemic shutdowns serves as an example, as it has been shown to primarily benefit elites and perpetuate uneven consumption patterns. (Source: 2021)"
        },
        {
            "question": "How has the shift to online education during the pandemic impacted educational and employment outcomes, particularly in relation to digital inequality?",
            "answer": "The digital shift in education during the pandemic has provided ease of access and dissemination of knowledge, but it also perpetuates inequalities and assumes students are digital natives with equal access to technology. Additionally, digitally focused skills education can exacerbate social inequalities, leading to low-status, low-paid, routine jobs or subsistence self-employment in the new economy."
