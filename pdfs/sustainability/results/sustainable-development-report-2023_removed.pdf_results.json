The world must invest boldly in all eight kinds of capital, including business, human, government, social, cultural, natural, and financial capital. Governments and corporations should make these investments, with governments leading in protecting natural capital and civil society promoting social and cultural capital. For instance, human capital is mainly the public sector's responsibility, while business capital is primarily in the private sector's domain. Cultural capital and diversity should be particularly emphasized to foster mutual understanding across cultures and nations."

            "answer": "The SDG Dashboards are presented for all countries where data permits, including those not in the SDG Index. The dashboards indicate whether a country is on track to achieve the goals by 2030 based on past performance. Trends are calculated for each indicator, using annual growth rates since 2015 and extrapolated to 2030."

            "answer": "The current edition of the audit report does not fully capture the multiple impacts of the war in Ukraine on the SDGs and the impacts of other geopolitical and security crises that have emerged over the past 12-18 months. The data for Ukraine correspond to the situation before February 2022, as many data points have not been able to be updated since then. The inclusion of an indicator on exports of major conventional weapons should not be interpreted as a value judgment in the context of current conflicts but rather as an effort to evaluate the trend towards disarmament."

            "question": "What new elements are included in the latest report and how are indicators affected?",
            "answer": "The report introduces additions to Table A.1, identifying replaced or modified indicators due to changes in methodologies and estimates from data providers. Additionally, a refinement has been made to the methodology for evaluating trends in countries already exceeding targets. For the first time, an overview of the world's progress is presented using a population-weighted average for all Member States."

            "answer": "The new addition is an estimation of the percentage of targets met by 2030 for all countries with sufficient data. However, due to changes in indicators and methodology, Index rankings and scores from one edition cannot be compared with previous editions. Part 2 provides time series results calculated retroactively using this year's indicators and methods, making them comparable across time."

            "answer": "Nitrogen emissions (kg/capita) and expropriations are now sourced from different multi-regional input-output databases provided by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). Previously, property rights were sourced from the World Justice Project, but it has been removed due to the suspension of future updates."

            "question": "Which countries were excluded from the Index due to missing data, and which countries are still included despite having less than 80% data coverage?",
            "answer": "The Index excludes countries that have data for less than 80% of the indicators, unless they have been in previous editions with at least 75% data coverage. The list of countries not included due to missing data is presented in Table A.3. However, all Member States are still included in the SDG Dashboards and each one features a country profile."

        {
            "question": "How are the indicators normalized after establishing the upper and lower bounds?",
            "answer": "The indicators are normalized using the rescaling formula: x' = (x - min(x)) / (max(x) - min(x)) x 100, where x is the raw data value, min(x) and max(x) are the upper and lower bounds, respectively, and x' is the normalized value. This ensures that all rescaled variables are expressed as ascending variables (higher values denote better performance)."

        {
            "question": "How are SDG Index scores computed, and what is the significance of the equal weighting assumption?",
            "answer": "SDG Index scores are computed by first estimating scores on each goal using the arithmetic mean of indicators for that goal. The equal weighting assumption is significant because it reflects policymakers' commitment to treat all SDGs equally and as an integrated and indivisible set of goals, meaning countries need to pay attention to all goals but focus particularly on those where they are furthest from achieving the SDGs and where incremental progress might be fastest."
        },
        {
            "question": "How are the goal scores averaged to obtain the final Index score in the Sustainable Development Report?",
            "answer": "The goal scores are averaged across all 17 SDGs to obtain the final Index score. Various sensitivity tests have been conducted, including comparisons of arithmetic mean versus geometric mean and simulations at the Index and Goal level. Monte Carlo simulations suggest caution when interpreting small differences between countries' Index scores and rankings due to the weighting scheme."

            "question": "How were the quantitative thresholds for the traffic light table established for indicators in the Methods Summary and Data Tables of the Dashboards?",
            "answer": "The thresholds were established based on statistical techniques and consultations with experts since 2016."
        },
        {
            "question": "Why is it important to consider areas of policy concern when averaging indicators for a country?",
            "answer": "Averaging across all indicators for a country may hide areas of policy concern if the country performs well on most indicators but faces serious shortfalls on one or two metrics within one indicator (the issue of \"substitutability\" or \"compensation\")."

        {
            "question": "How do SDG Dashboards determine which variables to focus on for high-income and upper-middle-income countries that have made progress on many dimensions but have shortfalls on individual variables?",
            "answer": "The SDG Dashboards focus exclusively on the two variables on which a country or region performs worst. These variables are rescaled from 0 to 3 based on how they compare to thresholds, and values worse than the red threshold are rescaled from 0 to 1."
        },
        {
            "question": "How were the values rescaled and what were the threshold values set for different ratings in the given context?",
            "answer": "The values better than the green threshold were rescaled from 2 to 3, where 2 corresponds to the value of the green threshold and 3 to the upper bound. The yellow/orange threshold was set as the value halfway between the red and green thresholds (1.5 after rescaling). Each interval between 0 and 3 is continuous. The average of the two rescaled variables on which the country performed worst was taken to identify the rating for the goal. A red rating is applied only if both the worst-performing indicators score red."

        {
            "question": "What determines the color of the SDG Dashboards for a country, and how are the indicators evaluated for achievement?",
            "answer": "The SDG Dashboards' color is determined by the performance of both best-performing indicators, which must be green for a country to score green. If a country has less than 50% of the indicators available under a goal, the goal's dashboard color is grey. The achievement of each indicator is evaluated based on the green threshold set for the SDG Dashboards, using historic data to estimate the country's progress and future pace towards that threshold."
        },
        {
            "question": "What does the difference in percentage points between the green threshold and a country's score represent, and how can trends be estimated at the indicator level?",
            "answer": "The difference in percentage points between the green threshold and a country's score denotes the gap that must be closed to meet the goal. To estimate trends at the indicator level, annual growth rates (annual percentage improvements) needed to achieve the target by 2030 are calculated and compared to the country's score. If the score is decreasing or stagnant and grows at a rate below 50% of the required growth rate, the country is falling behind or off track."
        },
        {
            "question": "According to the report, how is progress towards achieving the SDGs measured?",
            "answer": "Progress towards achieving the SDGs is measured using a four-arrow system based on the average annual growth rate since the adoption of the SDGs in 2015. The system describes progress as follows: scores that currently exceed the target but have decreased since 2015 (first arrow); scores that increase at a rate above 50% of the required growth rate but below the rate needed to achieve the target by 2030 (second arrow); scores that increase at the rate needed to achieve the target by 2030 or performance has already exceeded the achievement threshold (third arrow); and scores that have achieved or exceeded the target (fourth arrow)."
        },
        {
            "question": "Which indicators were used to generate trend indications and how were their growth rates assigned values?",
            "answer": "The indicators used to generate trend indications required time-series data. Each indicator trend was assigned a value on a scale from 0 to 4 based on its growth rate. Indicators with decreasing growth rates were rescaled from 0 to 1, where 0 corresponds to the worst decrease across countries on an indicator and 1 corresponds to an absolute stagnation over time (growth rate of 0)."
        },
        {
            "question": "How are growth rates rescaled and what do the intervals represent in the context of achieving a green threshold?",
            "answer": "Growth rates are rescaled into intervals of 1 to 2, 2 to 3, and 3 to 4. Here, 2 corresponds to half the growth rate necessary to achieve the green threshold, 3 to exactly the growth rate needed, and 4 to the highest growth rate among countries for a given indicator. Each interval is continuous. The trend for a country is calculated as the arithmetic average of all the re-scaled values of the trend indicators for that goal."
        },
        {
            "question": "According to the context, what do the goal trend categories mean in the given context?",
            "answer": "An average between 0 and 1 indicates a decreasing goal trend, between 1 and 2 represents a stagnating goal trend, between 2 and 3 indicates a moderately improving goal trend, and between 3 and 4 indicates an on-track goal trend. Countries missing a goal-level dashboard do not receive an overall goal trend calculation. Even if a country has experienced a decline in performance in the past year, it can still be considered on track based on past growth rates."
        },
        {
            "question": "What does the new refinement in the methodology indicate about countries that currently exceed an SDG target but have seen a decrease since 2015?",
            "answer": "The new refinement assigns an orange arrow to countries that currently exceed an SDG target but have seen a decrease since 2015, indicating that if the decreasing trend continues, the country may no longer meet the target in the future."
