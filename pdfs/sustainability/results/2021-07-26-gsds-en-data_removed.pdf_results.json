            "answer": "The target for nitrogen surpluses in Germany from 2028 to 2032 is 70 kilograms per hectare of utilised agricultural land. The calculation of the indicator includes nitrogen input from fertilisers, biological fixation, atmospheric deposition, seeds and plants, and animal feed. Nitrogen removal takes place through plant and animal market products, and any excess nitrogen may escape into the atmosphere, enrich the soil, or leach into groundwater."

            "answer": "The nitrogen surplus has remained at 93 kg/ha since 2011 due to the lack of further reductions in fertiliser use and livestock numbers since then. If the current trend continues, the goal of reducing the nitrogen surplus to 70 kg/ha by 2028-2032 will not be achievable. The significant reduction of the nitrogen surplus at the start of the 1990s was due to reduced fertiliser use and falling livestock numbers at that time."

        {
            "question": "Why did the nitrogen surplus decline less significantly in the later part of the time series?",

            "answer": "The indicator did not reflect increased global raw material extraction for consumption and investment in Germany during this period due to closer interdependence between the German economy and the rest of the world. However, investments, exports, and associated raw material input rose sharply in 2010 and 2011.

            "answer": "The raw material input productivity indicator expands the focus beyond abiotic materials to include biotic raw materials that originate from living organisms. While biotic raw materials are not inherently more resource-efficient or environment-friendly, their cultivation, use, and exploitation, as well as the associated social and environmental impact, must be considered. The raw material input productivity indicator looks at the entire associated primary raw material input, not just the tonnage of imported goods."

Settlement density looks at the number of inhabitants in relation to the amount of settlement and transport area, which includes residential building land, areas of special functional character (such as hospitals and schools), industrial and commercial land, mixed-use land (such as shopping streets), and areas for sports, leisure and recreation."

            "answer": "The reduction in settlement and transport area was 11% in rural regions compared to 4% in non-rural areas due to their distinctly lower settlement density. However, the settlement density in non-rural regions has been rising since 2011, indicating more efficient use of the area."

            "question": "Why are the official land-use statistics for 2016 not directly comparable to those for previous years?",
            "answer": "The switch from the old to the new land-use classification system was completed in 2016, and some areas of land have been reclassified without any actual change in their use. Additionally, relevant values were extrapolated based on the 2011 census to make comparisons possible."

            "answer": "In non-rural areas, efforts to reduce vacancy, encourage brownfield and infill sites development, and revive or raise density of new-build projects have been successful in preventing further land use and keeping population growth in check. However, rural areas have not seen similar progress."
        },
        {
            "question": "Why have some rural areas seen new land being built on despite shrinking population numbers?",
            "answer": "Despite shrinking population numbers, some rural areas continue to see new land being built on. This is despite efforts by local authorities to reduce land use through refusing or reversing land-use designations. Village development is being used to support authorities and private property owners in repurposing buildings within built-up areas. However, not all rural regions have been successful in reducing new land development."

            "question": "Why is it important to focus on brownfield development in revitalizing hollowed-out village centers?",
            "answer": "Brownfield development is important because it helps reduce the efficient use of infrastructure capacity and raises awareness of the disadvantages and dangers of land consumption. Additionally, there are plans to concentrate more on small and medium-sized urban centers to supplement the ongoing efforts of brownfield development."

            "question": "Why has there been an increase in transport volumes despite a decrease in the average number of manufacturing steps and an increase in the average distance between manufacturing and usage locations?",
            "answer": "This paradoxical situation arises due to a shift towards a less material-intensive pattern of demand, which is characterized by increasing demand for services. This shift leads to companies procuring more intermediate goods from domestic and international suppliers, resulting in higher transport volumes."

            "answer": "The critical ecological threshold of SDG 13 is important for human survival as climate changes are already evident and have caused an average air temperature rise of more than 1.6°C in Germany since the pre-industrial era. This rise includes a 0.3°C increase between 2015 and 2018. These consequences require swift and ambitious action to reduce climate-altering emissions and adapt to the consequences of climate change for sustainable global development and international cooperation."

            "answer": "The IPCC predicts that global warming exceeding 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels may result in irreversible losses and the passing of tipping points, increasing risks to nature and humanity. It is probable that the rise in temperature will already go beyond the 1.5-degree mark between 2030 and 2050 if no swift and effective action is taken to achieve global carbon neutrality by 2050. However, it is still possible to limit the temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius if sufficient action is taken now."

            "answer": "DACCS (Direct Air Carbon Capture and Storage) and BECCS (Bio-energy Carbon Capture and Storage) are two methods for reducing carbon emissions. DACCS captures CO2 directly from the atmosphere, while BECCS uses biomass as an energy source and stores the resulting CO2. While DACCS is not yet available on a large scale and raises energy-related concerns, BECCS faces criticism for potential environmental harm and competition with food production. Neither technology is currently industrial-scale. Additional research is needed to clarify legal questions surrounding their implementation."
