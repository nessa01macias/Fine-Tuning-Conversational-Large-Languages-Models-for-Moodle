            "answer": "While relative income disparities and relative poverty have remained constant, absolute poverty has decreased due to percentage increase in income levels across all income brackets. However, absolute income disparities have grown. Persistent low-income earning continues to worsen the effects of poverty. At-risk-of poverty rates have stayed the same, with the oldest age groups seeing a slight decrease. Student-age young adults and elderly people over 80 are particularly affected by persistent risk of poverty."

            "answer": "Despite stable relative income disparities and poverty levels, absolute poverty has decreased as income levels have risen uniformly across income brackets. However, absolute income disparities have widened. Persistent low-income situations intensify the repercussions of poverty. The persistently poor population's at-risk-of poverty rates have not changed significantly. Notably, older age groups have experienced a slight reduction in poverty risk, while student-age young adults and those aged over 80 continue to face high risks of poverty."

            "question": "How has poverty affected school attendance and what groups are at risk besides children in low-income households?",
            "answer": "Poverty makes school attendance more difficult due to financial constraints, reduces leisure time options, and increases the risk of marginalization. Besides children in low-income households, other groups at risk include those living alone, the underemployed, single parents, immigrants, people with disabilities, people with long-term illnesses, and imprisoned inmates. Additionally, child benefits have not been tied to an index, requiring an increase of between 47 and 68 percent to match their real value from 1994. The percentage of children in low-income households has risen from 10.2% (2016) to 10.5% (2018)."

        {
            "question": "Why hasn't Finland been successful in reducing poverty, despite some efforts?",
            "answer": "Finland has failed to meet its global obligations towards poverty reduction due to significant cuts in development assistance, decreases in humanitarian aid payments, and falling short of the required 0.2% contribution to least developed countries, which disproportionately affects entrepreneurs and the self-employed, many of whom live below the poverty line. However, some individual benefits such as guarantee pensions and minimum sickness and parental allowances were increased between 2016 and 2019."

            "answer": "Finland experienced a decrease of approximately 30% in humanitarian aid payments and fell short of the required 0.2% contribution to least developed countries (which was only 0.15% in 2019). Development assistance was cut by around 40%, even from Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) that directly help vulnerable populations. In contrast, individual benefits like guarantee pensions and minimum sickness and parental allowances saw increases between 2016 and 2019."

            "answer": "Due to the poor profitability of food production and the high proportion of leased land with short lease durations, proper soil care and conservation have not been achievable. However, there has been a reduction in the use of industrial commercial fertilizers, and efforts have been made in nutrient recycling and ensuring the purity of recycled nutrients. This has led to a decline in nitrogen and phosphorus levels in nutrient balances over the past 30 years.
