            "question": "How does the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) address the use of technology for social sustainability, and what is the specific tension identified between two targets related to technology access and income inequality?",
            "answer": "The SDGs prioritize technology-driven growth for social sustainability, as outlined in Target 9.c which aims to increase access to Information and Communications Technology (ICT). However, there is a tension identified between this goal and Target 10.1, which focuses on raising the relative income of the lower 40% within nations. While the increased use of technology can potentially reduce inequality by providing access to new opportunities and resources, lagging ICT skills and uneven distribution of technology can exacerbate existing inequalities within countries. Therefore, the question becomes whether digital technology has the capacity to fix income inequality or if it will only widen the gap. The chapter explores this issue further by discussing the three levels of the digital divide theory and the mode of production as reasons why digital technology may not solve income inequality."

            "question": "What are the main SDGs discussed in the chapter and what is the techno-optimistic view of ICTs in relation to them?",
            "answer": "The main SDGs discussed in the chapter include SDG 8, which aims at promoting sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all, and SDG 4, which promotes equitable quality education for all. The techno-optimistic view of ICTs holds that they have the potential to significantly contribute to achieving these goals. However, there is a tension between this perspective and the reality of unequal access and digital divide, which may change how we produce and distribute wealth. This tension also affects the implementation of these SDGs. Therefore, while ICTs offer great potential, addressing the challenges of unequal access and digital divide is crucial for realizing their transformative power."

            "question": "How does the uneven distribution of standard and advanced skills among 76 economies affect the pursuit of SDG 10's goal for reducing inequality?",
            "answer": "As per the context, the distribution of standard and advanced skills is highly uneven among the 76 economies. With only three economies reporting more than 60% of their populations engaged in standard computer tasks and no economy surpassing an 80% standard skill proportion, there exists a considerable disparity in digital skills. Moreover, just 11 economies have advanced skills over 10%, and none have advanced skills above 50%. These discrepancies contribute to the persistence of global inequality. Despite the progress made by developing countries in recent decades, they still face significant challenges in addressing the unequal distribution of skills within their borders. To effectively pursue SDG 10's goal for reducing inequality, efforts must be directed towards improving access to education, training programs, and technology to help bridge these gaps."

            "answer": "Instead of being solely an infrastructure problem, the digital divide is viewed as a multifaceted issue where new divisions emerge as more individuals and groups gain physical access to the internet (Castells, 2017; Hafner & Lyon, 2014; Norris, 2001; Shapiro, 2020; Wellman, 2015). Three levels of the digital divide have been recognized: the access gap, the skills gap, and the content gap (Wellman, 2015). The access gap refers to the disparity in availability and affordability of internet access. The skills gap pertains to the differences in digital literacy and ability to effectively use technology. Lastly, the content gap involves the unequal distribution of relevant and high-quality online resources."

            "question": "According to the given theory, how do unequal distributions of resources lead to unequal access to digital technologies and what are the resulting consequences?",
            "answer": "The theory posits that inequalities in society result in an unequal distribution of resources, which in turn leads to unequal access to digital technologies. This unequal access to digital technologies then results in unequal outcomes of participation in society. Furthermore, unequal participation in society reinforces existing inequalities and unequal distributions of resources. The characteristics of contemporary society play a crucial role in understanding the workings of this third-level digital divide. Specifically, the theory highlights that the unequal access to digital technologies depends not only on resource inequalities but also on the specific characteristics of these technologies themselves. Therefore, the unequal access to digital technologies contributes to perpetuating and even exacerbating social inequalities. (Source: (2020), pp. 31, 117)"

        {
            "question": "How does the production of information contribute to the digital divides and exacerbate economic inequality?",
            "answer": "The digital divides result from the shift towards information production being more valuable than material goods. High-skilled workers utilize new technology to perform tasks previously done by low-skilled, low-income earners, leading to increased economic inequality. This stratifies society into the information elite, the participatory majority, and the unconnected and excluded. The use of digital media in the network society further widens this gap. There is evidence to suggest that these digital divides intensify existing economic disparities. For instance, high-skilled workers have access to better paying jobs and opportunities for advancement, while those without the necessary skills are left behind. Additionally, the cost of accessing and using digital technologies can be prohibitive for many individuals and communities, further perpetuating the divide. Overall, the digital revolution has led to a new form of economic inequality that is shaped by access to and proficiency in digital technologies."

            "question": "How does the digital divide impact the achievement of SDG 10 targets, specifically in relation to the high-skilled and low-skilled workers?",
            "answer": "The digital divide, as demonstrated through its three levels, can hinder the attainment of certain SDG 10 targets. For instance, providing universal internet access to least developed countries may lead to increased productivity among high-skilled workers, resulting in higher income. However, this technological advancement might leave low-skilled workers unproductive and without a stable source of income. Additionally, the digital divide can make it challenging to reduce relative inequality within countries, as the benefits of new technologies tend to favor those who are already relatively advantaged. Therefore, while the digital divide can contribute to progress towards SDG 9.c (providing affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy services), it could potentially come at the expense of SDG 10.1 (by increasing inequality)."

The relative income gap between those who have access to advanced technologies and those who do not may widen, as the former group benefits more from the digital economy. This contradicts the goal of reducing inequality within countries (target 10.1).

            "question": "How do workers moving to other industries and the automation of low-skilled employment affect wages in different industries?",
            "answer": "When workers relocate to other industries, they introduce an extra supply of labor if the receiving industry doesn't experience at least an equivalent increase in demand for labor. This excess supply can lead to increased competition and lower wages in those industries. Conversely, the automation of low-skilled employment brings down wages for all similar jobs due to reduced need for human labor. However, workers with the right skills that complement digital technology, such as operating or developing machines, or professions like writing or athletics, may be less affected by these trends. Their value remains high because their skills are still in demand despite technological advancements. In summary, the impact on wages depends on whether there is a corresponding increase in demand for labor in the receiving industry or the specific skillset of the worker. For low-skilled workers, however, the trend is generally towards decreasing wages due to increased competition from both human and automated labor."

            "question": "How did the emergence of digital technologies contribute to the economy according to certain market-based economic theories, and how does it compare to the first industrial revolution?",
            "answer": "According to certain market-based economic theories, the emergence of digital technologies is seen as the dawn of a new industrial revolution. While this process may not raise the wages of specific groups at a higher rate than the national average, it is expected to raise the average wage at a faster rate overall. Comparing this to the first industrial revolution, mass production emerged and transformed the way people worked, lived, and related to one another, which was coined as the capitalist mode of production by Marx and Engels (1959, p. 51). In the former industrial revolution, the mode of production led to significant changes in society. Therefore, while the impact of digital technologies on wages may differ from the first industrial revolution, both revolutions have had profound effects on the economy and society as a whole."

            "answer": "Digital technology allows a few individuals to produce and provide goods and services to increasing numbers of users, often replacing lower-skilled labor in the process. This leads to economic growth through increased production, but also creates economic inequality between those with and without the necessary skills. Additionally, when there is competition between producers, the unit price of these goods and services is driven down to near-irrelevant levels for buyers. Therefore, while digital technology can make individuals extremely productive, it also has the potential to widen the gap between the haves and have-nots in terms of economic opportunities."

            "answer": "Marx's prediction of the overthrowing of capitalism due to falling profit rates has not materialized because subsequent theories argue that capitalism is more adaptable than Marx gave it credit for. Schumpeter, in particular, posited that the process of creative destruction sustains long-term economic growth and keeps capitalism as the optimal mode of production. This process involves the continuous introduction of new products, processes, and industries, which disrupt old ones and create new markets and opportunities. Thus, rather than being overthrown, capitalism evolves and remains the dominant economic system. (1959,. 15) and (1942 ) are key sources for this information."

            "answer": "Creative destruction refers to the process by which new products, processes, and industries replace outdated ones, leading to economic disruption and the emergence of new markets and opportunities. This ongoing process of innovation and change helps sustain long-term economic growth and keeps capitalism as the optimal mode of production. The idea was introduced by Joseph Schumpeter (1942 ), who argued that this continuous process of innovation and disruption prevents stagnation and ensures that capitalism remains adaptive and responsive to changing economic conditions."

            "answer": "The persistence of relics from the feudal mode of production, such as the nobility in Great Britain, coexists with the emergence of new occupations like social media influencers and the sprouting of new social classes such as the precariat. While some may find appeal in the seemingly utopian vision of social media influencers, the majority of people are more likely to find themselves in the precarious situation of temporary and part-time employment without job security in the gig economy. This shift towards a new social order is driven by technological change into the digital mode of production. (Sources: [2022], [Khamis et al., 2017], [Standing, 2014], [2020])"

            "answer": "According to Marx and Engels, socialism is predicted to succeed capitalism as the next mode of production. However, they also noted that this may not be the case everywhere and socialism may not be the inevitable next step. Marx specifically emphasized the importance of historical preconditions in the development of any mode of production, as he wrote about in \"Das Kapital\" (1867). In particular, Marx analyzed the specific conditions of Western European society during the 19th century. Therefore, while the sustainability of capitalism into the Second Machine Age is uncertain, the historical context and preconditions outlined by Marx provide valuable insights into understanding the potential emergence of a new mode of production."

            "question": "Why is it necessary for any evaluation of the change in mode of production to be society-specific, taking into account the unique historical preconditions and production processes?",
            "answer": "The evaluation of the change in mode of production must be society-specific because the historical context and unique production processes of each society play a significant role in determining how the change unfolds. Lessons learned from one society may not directly apply to another, as the impact of the changing mode of production can vary greatly depending on the particular societal context. Additionally, there are numerous potential trajectories for the mode of production to take in various circumstances, making it impossible to evaluate them all within the scope of a single chapter. Therefore, a nuanced understanding of the historical and socio-economic conditions of each society is essential when analyzing the change in mode of production. This approach acknowledges the complexity of global economic transformations and emphasizes the importance of considering the unique experiences and realities of individual societies."
