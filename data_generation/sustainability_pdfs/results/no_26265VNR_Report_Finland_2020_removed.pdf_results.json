            "answer": "Income transfers significantly reduced the number of people at risk of low income and narrowed the poverty gap more effectively than the average in Finland during the year 2018. Despite this progress, poverty remains an issue for approximately 11.5% of the population in larger cities and among those of Finnish and foreign origin. Access to services is becoming increasingly challenging in smaller cities and rural areas. To further address poverty, developing a social security system that equalizes income distribution is essential. (Source: No citation provided in context)"

It is the responsibility of all authorities, education providers, and employers to ensure equality between different population groups in their activities. One specific goal of the act is to promote gender equality and prevent gender-based discrimination. Studies indicate that individuals with a minority background, particularly visible minorities and those belonging to multiple minorities, face greater vulnerability to discrimination than the general population. According to a recent survey conducted by the Finnish National Bureau of Statistics, attitudes towards equality in Finland appear to have become more positive, with increasing tolerance towards sexual and gender minorities. However, it's essential to continue implementing support measures alongside these policies to address the varying starting points arising from different backgrounds."

People with disabilities face significant challenges in working life and other aspects of life. There is substantial evidence indicating discrimination against the Roma and other ethnic minorities in employment. Additionally, attitudes towards the Roma and people with disabilities remain negative. Despite efforts for improvement, progress has been limited. Therefore, addressing these issues requires targeted policies and initiatives to promote equality and inclusion. For instance, implementing inclusive hiring practices, providing reasonable accommodations, and raising awareness about disability and ethnicity biases can help reduce discrimination and create a more equitable society. Furthermore, fostering positive attitudes towards these groups through education and public campaigns can contribute to long-term change. By taking comprehensive actions at multiple levels, we can work towards creating an inclusive and accessible labor market for all individuals, regardless of their health conditions or ethnic backgrounds."

            "answer": "The LNOB principle was discussed and an implementation plan was adopted, but progress has not been made according to expectations. The process of drafting an amendment to the Act contributed to implementing the aims of LNOB, but since the Act does not cover all areas related to LNOB, it is necessary to create a national action plan for full implementation along with the relevant stakeholders. The Declaration must be implemented in accordance with the views of all parties involved. In national follow-up and disaggregation of data, the LNOB principle is taken into account in three ways: firstly, national sustainable development indicators focus directly on issues linked to the LNOB principle. Additionally, the LNOB principle is considered when setting targets and monitoring progress towards these targets. Lastly, the LNOB principle is integrated into policy planning and budgeting processes."

To maintain the non-politicization of sustainable development, it is vital that this agenda is considered everyone's responsibility, rather than being linked solely to particular political movements or parties. This perspective is reflected in the Finnish society's emphasis on the 2030 Agenda.

Previously, commitments to sustainable development were perceived as stilted and unappealing to businesses, making it difficult to attract their engagement. However, the implementation of the SDGs emphasizes the importance of collective action and recognizes that sustainable development cannot be achieved solely by governments or NGOs. This approach has made sustainable development more appealing to private sector actors, who are now actively contributing to its implementation. Additionally, the SDGs offer clear goals and targets, which can be integrated into companies' business models and reporting frameworks, allowing them to demonstrate their commitment to sustainability and create shared value for all stakeholders.

            "answer": "Despite maintaining low international standards in income and wealth inequalities, Finland has experienced an increase in absolute income disparities, even as income levels have risen uniformly across all income brackets, leading to a decline in absolute poverty. However, there are still more men than women with payment defaults. This trend suggests that while overall poverty may be decreasing, certain demographic groups continue to face financial challenges. In the context of societal improvement and climate change preparedness, it is essential to address these disparities and support those who are disproportionately affected. Specifically, efforts should be made to understand why more men than women have payment defaults and provide targeted interventions to help alleviate this issue. By addressing these disparities, we can create a more equitable and inclusive society that is better prepared for future challenges."

            "answer": "Persistent low-income earning can lead to significant consequences for individuals and society as a whole. In Finland, while persistent at-risk-of poverty rates have remained constant, there have been slight declines in the oldest age groups. However, student-age young adults and those aged over 80 continue to face high risks of poverty. Gender differences also emerge in older age groups, where poverty affects women disproportionately more than men. To address these issues, Finland aims to maintain a relatively equal distribution of income and prevent the intergenerational transmission of poverty. This challenge requires ongoing efforts to ensure that policies and resources effectively target and support vulnerable populations. Additionally, addressing the root causes of poverty, such as lack of education and employment opportunities, is crucial for long-term success."

            "answer": "Respect for democracy, rule of law, and fundamental human rights form the bedrock of Finland's welfare approach. These principles provide a strong foundation for ensuring individual well-being and social cohesion. However, despite a minor decrease in reported instances of discrimination at the population level since 2015, research reveals that people from minority backgrounds continue to experience discrimination more frequently than others. This issue contributes to widening social gaps and perpetuating cycles of inequality and social exclusion that can persist across generations. Addressing these challenges requires a multifaceted response, including targeted policies and initiatives aimed at fostering greater inclusion and reducing barriers to equal opportunity for all members of Finnish society."
