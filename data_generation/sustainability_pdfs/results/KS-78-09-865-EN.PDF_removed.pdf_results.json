Specifically, there have been moderately favorable changes for GDP per capita and resource productivity. The changes for 'energy consumption of transport,' 'healthy life years,' and 'employment rate of older workers' have been moderately favorable as well. However, both headline indicators of climate change and energy have experienced moderately unfavorable changes. The risk of poverty rate and figures on the abundance of common birds remained broadly stable. EU Member States have planned policies and measures to address these challenges, including the use of carbon sinks, flexible mechanisms, and other initiatives."

            "answer": "Economic growth continued throughout the period, but regional disparities grew, and households saved less. Most employment indicators progressed in line with Lisbon targets, but the overall employment rate lacked impetus. Labour productivity increased, and energy intensity decreased as planned. However, faster progress is needed in increasing spending on research and development to reach the target.

With additional policies and mechanisms, the EU-15 is projected to overachieve its target.

There was a short-term increase in investments in eco-friendly modes such as rail and ports during the early years of the decade, but expenditure patterns have since returned to favoring road.

The share of road infrastructure investments fell from 60% in 2000 to 53% in 2003, but returned to about 60% by 2005-6.

            "answer": "Despite the contribution of new passenger cars to the increase in transport greenhouse gas emissions between 2000 and 2007, the growth rate slowed down compared to an earlier period. This was partly due to the fact that road transport accounted for 94% of total transport greenhouse gas emissions in 2007, and the emissions from new passenger cars remained significantly above the necessary path to meet emissions targets. In contrast, emissions of air pollutants, such as ozone precursors and particulate matter, have been steadily declining since 1990 due to the progressive tightening of emission standards."

            "answer": "The data indicates that people in the EU-27 are living longer and healthier lives, with improvements in reducing deaths due to chronic diseases, suicides, and accidents at work. However, challenges remain in addressing environmental determinants of health, such as exposure to air pollution by particulate matter and ozone, and the production of toxic chemicals. Despite a decreasing fishing fleet, fishing capacity has not decreased, and there has been no significant improvement in preventing forest degradation. (Refer to Table 6 for details.)"

However, there was an increase of healthy life years at birth (0.2% per year for females and 0.7% for males) between 2005 and 2007. These differences mean that men are catching up with women in terms of life expectancy as well as healthy life years. Additionally, the death rate due to chronic diseases decreased by 1.9% per year in the EU-27."

            "answer": "There has been a favorable shift away from the production of toxic chemicals towards less harmful products. Exposure to air pollution, specifically particulate matter, increased by 1.6% between 2000 and 2007, while ozone exposure rose by 18.5%. However, it is not possible to discern clear trends as they have fluctuated nearly every year. The share of the population in the EU-27 declaring that they suffer from excessive noise favorably declined between 2005 and 2007, but this indicator also fluctuates considerably from year to year. On a positive note, efforts to improve health and safety in workplaces in the EU-27 are showing progress."

The social inclusion theme is summarized as having mixed trends."

This development aligns with one of the objectives of the SDS. However, the increasing life expectancy at age 65, coupled with under-replacement fertility rates, will lead to a growing older population and a shrinking working-age population. Immigration has been greater than emigration but has decreased from 2002 to 2008."
