            "answer": "The sustainable development agenda has risen to become an integral part of corporate responsibility in Finland, offering a new way to discuss difficult issues. It was adopted by businesses as a response to the increasing attention given to corporate responsibility issues during the internationalisation of corporations. Despite the Finnish government's role in enforcing laws and implementing the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, businesses have taken on this agenda to address their responsibilities beyond legal requirements. The drafting of the 42 Guidelines occurred during a previous term."

Additionally, the requirements for project administration and developmental impact criteria in conventional development cooperation are seen as too stringent for private sector actors. This can make it problematic for ensuring a high degree of transparency."

            "answer": "A sustainable development policy must be consistent with the global 2030 Agenda to ensure coherence and effectiveness. This is crucial because various administrative branches and social sectors come together under the sustainable development agenda at both the global and national levels.

However, the communication \"Harnessing Globalisation by 2025,\" published in 2017, mentions neither the 2030 Agenda nor related issues such as human rights or inequality, despite featuring sustainable development as a primary theme.
