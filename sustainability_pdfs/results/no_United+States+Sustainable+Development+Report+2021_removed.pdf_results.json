            "question": "Why has the engagement of the federal and state governments in the United States regarding the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) been weaker compared to other countries?",
            "answer": "Although universities, businesses, NGOs, and cities in the US are aligning with the SDGs, the involvement of the federal and state governments has been far less prominent than in peer nations. This discrepancy is particularly noticeable when comparing the US to other countries in this regard. The evidence indicates that social and economic gaps in America are worsening on various dimensions, including wages, residential segregation, and child poverty. Despite these challenges, the SDGs have not yet gained significant traction in US politics and public policy."

            "answer": "The color and arrow system in Figure 3 indicates decreasing (red) or improving (green) scores on particular indicators, with arrows pointing left for decreases and right for improvements. Despite a possible decline in performance over the past year, a state can still be considered 'on track' if long-term structural changes show improvement since the adoption of the SDGs in 2015. The methodology focuses more on long-term trends rather than annual changes that may be cyclical or temporary. For further details on the development of colors and rankings, refer to the Methodology section."
        },
        {
            "question": "How does the color and arrow system determine whether a state is \"on track\" regarding its SDG progress?",
            "answer": "The color and arrow system in Figure 3 determines whether a state is \"on track\" by considering both the current score and the historical trend. Even if a state has experienced a decline in performance over the past year, it can still be considered \"on track\" if the long-term structural changes indicate improvement since the adoption of the SDGs in 2015. The methodology places greater emphasis on these long-term trends rather than annual changes that might be cyclical or temporary. Further information about the development of colors and rankings can be found in the Methodology section."

In contrast, West Virginia and Mississippi rank #49 and #50, respectively, with only about 31% progress. This means Vermont has made significantly more progress than the furthest states. However, to meet the SDGs by 2030, states need to improve scores by approximately five and a half points each year, which is more than the average improvement over the last five years combined. Additionally, the year 2030 marks the projected tipping point for the climate crisis."

        {
            "question": "Why is it essential to address the climate crisis while taking into account inequality and justice?",
            "answer": "It's crucial to address the climate crisis while addressing its impact on inequality and justice because the lack of progress in this area represents real-life struggles faced daily by people in the US, including hunger, violence, disenfranchisement, and insecurity. The climate crisis has the potential to exacerbate these issues. To effectively address both crises, bold, coordinated, interdisciplinary action is necessary. (See Environmental Justice section for more detail.)"

States with a Republican governor have a 2.1% lower vaccination rate than states with a Democratic governor. Poor educational quality accounts for a difference of up to 7.4 percentage points in vaccine coverage between states with the lowest and highest educational systems. For instance, Mississippi (scoring 19.3) and Massachusetts (scoring 80.1). Further research is required to understand the cultural reasons behind the modern Republican embrace of \"natural freedom\" and \"hegemonic freedom\" and its influence on vaccination rates."

These regions, notably the South and Southwest, have lagged behind other areas in both vaccination rates and academic achievement (r=0.64). For instance, Figures 11 and 12 from the report illustrate this trend. Overall, the rejection of prosocial behaviors and scientific advice in these areas has negatively impacted America's response to the pandemic, resulting in unnecessary illnesses and deaths, as well as hindering national progress on sustainable development."
