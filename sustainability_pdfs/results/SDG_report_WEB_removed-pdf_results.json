      "question": "What are the three main pillars of the EU gender equality strategy and how does it aim to implement them?",
      "answer": "The three main pillars of the EU gender equality strategy are: (1) freedom from gender-based violence and gender stereotypes, (2) thriving in a gender equal economy, and (3) leading equally throughout society. The strategy takes a dual approach of gender mainstreaming combined with targeted measures and intersectionality as a cross-cutting principle. A task force on equality was set up in 2019 to mainstream gender and other equality considerations into all policy areas. The EU aims to lead by example in the field of gender equality, with a gender-balanced College of Commissioners and proposals such as the directive on combating violence against women and domestic violence, the Digital Services Act, and the pay transparency directive. However, there is still a significant gender employment gap, with only 19% of specialists and one in three STEM graduates being women. The EU pursues the target of 20 million employed specialists by 2030, but there is a severe gender balance issue, particularly in advanced skills areas."

The top 20% of the population were earning almost five times more than the bottom 20%. Additionally, there are significant regional asymmetries across Member States regarding access to basic public services, labor markets, competitiveness, and productivity. These disparities are particularly pronounced in rural areas, where access to basic public services remains a challenge. Although the gap between poverty risks in urban and rural areas has narrowed in recent years, rural areas continue to be at higher risk due to factors like out migration, limited access to services, weaker labor markets, and fewer educational opportunities. EU-level developments related to SDG 10 since 2015 show a mixed but generally favorable trend, as income inequalities had been decreasing before the pandemic.
