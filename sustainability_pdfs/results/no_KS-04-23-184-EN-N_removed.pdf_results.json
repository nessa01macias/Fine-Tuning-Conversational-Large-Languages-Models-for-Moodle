Regarding SDG 14 (Life below Water), the EU has made only moderate progress due to varying developments in monitored areas. Another issue is the slowdown in the EU's recycling rate of municipal waste, which puts it off track from meeting its respective target by 2030. Stronger efforts will be required to address these challenges and achieve the EU's sustainability objectives."

            "question": "How has the EU's progress towards certain sustainability goals been affected by changes in transportation, population growth, and recycling rates?",
            "answer": "The EU's progress towards its sustainability goals has been impacted in several ways. Public passenger transport modes have lost market share to cars, resulting in a decrease in their usage. This trend was intensified during the pandemic. Population growth has led to an increase in settlement areas and land take, which has outpaced population growth. Moreover, the EU's recycling rate of municipal waste has slowed down in recent years, making it harder for the EU to meet its respective targets for reducing waste and increasing recycling by 2030. These factors have contributed to uneven progress towards SDG 14 (Life below Water) and other sustainability goals."

            "answer": "Marine conservation and sustainable fisheries have been making progress in recent years, with the extent of marine protected areas increasing significantly since 2012. The goal of having 30% of marine waters under protection by 2030 seems attainable based on this trend. However, it's essential to note that available data do not indicate the conservation status or effectiveness of these protected sites in safeguarding species and habitats. Regarding fisheries, model-based indicators suggest improvements in fish stock biomass and fishing pressure in both the North-East Atlantic and Mediterranean and Black Sea regions. Although the situation in the Mediterranean and Black Sea remains less favorable compared to the North-East Atlantic. Overall, while there are positive signs, continued monitoring and evaluation are necessary to assess the true impact of these conservation and fishery management initiatives."

            "question": "How has the mean surface seawater acidity changed in recent years, and what impact does this have on marine ecosystems?",
            "answer": "The mean surface seawater acidity has continued to increase and reached another unprecedented high over pre-industrial levels in 2021. This trend is due to the absorption of carbon dioxide into the world's oceans. The increasing acidity can negatively affect various aspects of marine life, including calcification processes, growth rates, and survival of organisms such as corals, mollusks, and planktonic organisms. Eutrophication, on the other hand, results from excessive nutrient input into bodies of water, leading to harmful algal blooms, oxygen depletion, and other detrimental effects on aquatic ecosystems."

            "answer": "According to recent reports, despite a slight increase in emissions in 2022 compared to 2021, overall emissions remain below pre-pandemic levels and continue their long-term downward trend. This progress can be attributed to various factors such as international trade declines, decreases in gas consumption, and crude oil import price changes. Additionally, the EU's response to the war in Ukraine includes temporary protection for displaced persons, which may further contribute to reducing emissions through population movements and other measures aimed at promoting sustainability. However, it is important to note that more comprehensive data will become available in future monitoring reports, providing a more detailed and nuanced picture of the situation."

Even during times of increasing median income, the relative poverty rate may remain stable or increase if there are significant changes in income distribution across the population. For instance, rates of people living in jobless or quasi-jobless households with severe material and social deprivation are likely to decrease during economic recoveries.

While estimates suggest that the number of premature deaths due to exposure to air pollution has fallen, it can still conceivably underreport deaths due to hepatitis B and C. Urban populations, especially those with lower socio-economic status, are disproportionately affected due to their proximity to sources of fine particulate matter emission. Air pollutants are primarily emitted through fuel combustion, making urban areas particularly susceptible. Air pollution has been a major environmental policy concern since the late 1970s.

            "answer": "The incidence rate of non-fatal work accidents for men (3.1) is significantly higher than for women (0.3). Men's higher risk of work accidents is due to their greater representation in professions associated with a higher risk of accidents. Non-fatal work accidents can result in permanent disabilities, forcing people to leave the labor market or change jobs. In 2020, there were 1,444 non-fatal work accidents per 100,000 employed persons, making them more common than fatal accidents. Access to healthcare, including timely and affordable preventive and curative care, remains a priority for many countries. (Context: There is a considerable difference between the sexes regarding the incidence rate for work accidents. Women's rate was negligible compared to men's. Non-fatal accidents can lead to permanent disabilities and force people out of the labor market or change jobs. The incidence rate for non-fatal accidents in 2020 was 1,444 per 100,000 employed persons. Access to healthcare is a significant issue in many countries.)"

As a result, the country reached a tertiary education attainment rate of 42.0% in 2022 and is well on track to meeting its target. Additionally, there appears to be a correlation between the degree of urbanization and tertiary attainment levels."

            "question": "What is the difference in the percentage of people aged 25 to 34 with tertiary education between urban areas (cities) and non-urban areas (towns, suburbs, and rural regions) in the European Union in 2022?",
            "answer": "In 2022, 42.0% of the population aged 25 to 34 in the European Union had attained tertiary education. However, this figure varied significantly across different types of settlements. Specifically, 52.2% of those living in cities had completed tertiary education, compared to 35.9% in towns and suburbs, and 30.2% in rural areas. This indicates a substantial educational divide between urban and non-urban populations. Additionally, it's worth noting that the trend of increasing tertiary education attainment among 25- to 34-year-olds has been ongoing since 2002 in all EU member states."

            "answer": "The lowest scoring countries are located in south-east Europe. Connection rates may not reach 100% due to high connection costs, particularly in rural areas with low population densities. Currently, only larger agglomerations are required to introduce secondary treatment, while smaller ones must apply appropriate treatments or alternative solutions when wastewater is collected. However, the European Commission's proposal to review the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive suggests extending this obligation to smaller agglomerations as well. Diffuse pollution from agriculture, accidental spillage of harmful substances, discharge of untreated or insufficiently treated domestic and industrial wastewater, and atmospheric deposition of pollutants like mercury pose threats to both human and environmental health. Additionally, it's essential to note that connection rates might not reach 100% due to disproportionately high connection costs, especially in rural areas with low population densities."

            "question": "What is Primary Energy Consumption, and how is it measured differently between current usage and the 2020-2030 period?",
            "answer": "Primary Energy Consumption refers to a country's total energy demand, including the energy sector's own consumption, losses during transformation and distribution, and final consumption by end users. However, for measuring progress towards the EU's 2020 and 2030 energy efficiency targets, Primary Energy Consumption is calculated as gross inland energy consumption minus non-energy use of energy carriers and international aviation. In other words, it excludes natural gas used in non-energy products and international aviation emissions. Therefore, the measurement of Primary Energy Consumption varies between the current usage and the 2020-2030 period due to the subtraction of international aviation from the calculation in the latter case."

            "question": "What is the difference between primary energy consumption, gross final energy consumption, and final energy consumption, specifically regarding the inclusion of ambient heat?",
            "answer": "Primary energy consumption refers to the total amount of energy extracted or produced from natural resources before any processing or transformation occurs. Gross final energy consumption, also known as gross energy consumption, includes primary energy consumption, as well as energy commodities delivered for energy purposes to various sectors like industry, transport, households, etc., and the consumption of electricity and heat by the energy branch. However, it excludes ambient heat, which is defined as primary energy consumption minus the gross inland consumption of ambient heat through heat pumps. Final energy consumption, also known as energy use or end-use energy consumption, measures the energy use by end users, such as households, industry, and transport. It is calculated as the gross final energy consumption minus the energy losses in distribution and transmission. In summary, primary energy consumption is the broadest category, while final energy consumption is the narrowest one, and gross final energy consumption sits in between, excluding ambient heat but including other energy commodities and losses."

            "question": "What is the definition and difference between primary energy consumption and final energy consumption, particularly in relation to energy efficiency targets from 2020 to 2030?",
            "answer": "Primary energy consumption refers to the total amount of raw energy resources extracted or imported and used in an economy, excluding energy used by the energy sector itself, losses during energy transformation and distribution, and non-energy uses of energy carriers. Final energy consumption, on the other hand, measures the actual energy delivered to consumers for their use, including ambient heat and international aviation, but excluding energy consumed by the energy sector and losses during transmission and distribution. The difference lies in the fact that primary energy consumption includes upstream processes such as extraction and transportation, while final energy consumption focuses on the end-use of energy by consumers. In terms of energy efficiency targets from 2020 to 2030, final energy consumption is the relevant metric as it reflects the progress made in reducing energy waste and improving energy productivity at the consumer level."

            "question": "Why does the gender gap persist in the incidence rate of work-related injuries despite a decreasing trend since 2010?",
            "answer": "The gender gap in the incidence rate of work-related injuries is due to the fact that activities with the highest incidence rates are mostly male-dominated. In 2020, the incidence rate for women was 0.3 per 100 000 persons, while for men it was 3.1. This difference can be attributed to the fact that more men are employed in industries with higher risks than women. However, it's important to note that safety at work is not the only component of decent work. Fair income and social protection are also essential. Additionally, during the pandemic in 2020, the number of employed people fell, but the number of fatal accidents did not decrease by the same magnitude. This increase in the incidence rate may also be attributed to this factor."

            "answer": "Income inequality can lead to several negative consequences for societies, including the hindrance of social cohesion, lost opportunities for many, reduction in social trust in institutions, and disproportionate exposure to adverse environmental impacts. Technological innovation and financial globalization are key drivers of income inequality within countries, favoring those with specific skills or accumulated wealth. The income gap between the rich and the poor remains large in many countries, and analyzing income distribution through the income quintile share ratio can provide insight into this issue. This ratio compares the income received by the top 20% of the population with the lowest 20%. For example, if the top 20% earn ten times more than the bottom 20%, the income quintile share ratio would be 10:1. The transition to a climate-neutral society also needs to be managed carefully to prevent rising inequality."

However, it's essential to consider potential methodological changes in data collection, specifically in Germany and France in 2020. Since data from 2021 refers to people's income in 2020, the full extent of the economic recovery post-pandemic remains uncertain. Additionally, economic inequality's impact on children's long-term opportunities is a significant concern. Regarding the latter, research suggests that unequal income distribution can negatively affect children's prospects in life, including their educational attainment, future earnings, and overall well-being.

            "answer": "The income gap between the richest and poorest families can hinder children's development and human potential by limiting their access to childcare services. Families with young children who fall into the lower income brackets often struggle to afford childcare leave or secure a guaranteed place in early childhood care. This lack of access can result in disadvantages in various aspects of childhood, including physical and mental health and educational opportunities. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated societal inequality and widened the income gap, making it even more challenging for low-income families to provide adequate care for their children. For instance, in the European Union, the income of the richest 20% of the population was 4.97 times higher than that of the poorest 20% in 2021, while the bottom 40% earned only 13.3% of the total income.

            "question": "How did net carbon removals from land use and forestry change between 1990 and 2021 in the EU?",
            "answer": "Net carbon removals from land use and forestry in the EU decreased by 0.6% between 1990 and 2021. Although forest land carbon removals increased during the first half of the period, they declined in the second half, resulting in a total fall of 36.4% in net removals from all land types. This decrease in carbon sequestration was not fully offset by reductions in CO2 emissions from other sources. Therefore, overall greenhouse gas emissions in the sector may have risen despite efforts to increase forest cover and reduce emissions from other sources. Additionally, it's important to note that these trends could have various causes, such as changes in agricultural practices, deforestation, and climate conditions. Further research would be needed to understand the underlying drivers behind these trends."

            "answer": "During the last five years, there was a decrease of 28.7% in net removals, resulting in 211.8 Mt of CO2-equivalent in 2021. Although net removals still compensated for 6.0% of emissions in 2021, this is a lower share compared to previous years. The net carbon removal target for land use and forestry is at least 310 Mt of CO2-equivalent by 2030, which is significantly higher than the current net removals. Emissions associated with energy consumption have decreased due to reduced energy consumption and increased use of renewables. A sectoral breakdown of the economy from 1990 to 2021 shows that all sectors except transport reduced their emissions over this period."

            "answer": "The sector with the largest contribution to total emissions in 2021 was energy users, specifically those involved in fuel combustion. This shift occurred due to a decrease in energy consumption across industries and a significant increase in the use of renewable energy sources for electricity generation. In 2021, renewable energy accounted for 37.5% of electricity consumption, while fuel combustion by energy users accounted for 27.4% of the total emissions. Prior to this, energy industries had been the leading sector in terms of emissions due to their heavy reliance on fossil fuels for power generation. However, recent trends in energy consumption and the adoption of renewable energy have resulted in a change in the ranking of the top emitting sectors."

This contradictory trend can be explained by the fact that the growth in renewable energy usage was not enough to offset the continued reliance on fossil fuels in the building sector. However, it's worth noting that transport emissions dropped by 8.9% during the same timeframe due to a reduction in fossil fuel use and an increase in the consumption of renewable fuels. In total, renewable energy contributed 21.8% to the country's gross final energy consumption in 2021."

            "answer": "In 2021, the EU changed its data collection method to the World Harmonized Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP), which resulted in higher emission values due to its representation of a vehicle's on-road emissions. The net carbon removal from land use and forestry in the EU amounted to 211.8 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent, while 13% of the energy consumed in the EU came from renewable sources. To maintain equally stringent manufacturer targets, these values were also converted to WLTP-based values. The average CO2 emissions per km from new passenger cars registered in the EU fell continuously between 2007 and 2020, reaching 107.9 g/km in 2020 – a 9.4% reduction since 2015."

            "answer": "From 1980 to 2021, weather- and climate-related events resulted in a total of $559.8 billion in economic losses. However, these estimates only reflect monetized direct damages to certain assets and do not include losses related to mortality and health, cultural heritage, or ecosystem services, which would significantly raise the overall damage estimate. These intangible losses are often difficult to quantify and therefore not always considered in economic assessments. Additionally, reported losses do not capture the full extent of damages to human systems and ecosystems. For instance, they exclude indirect damages, such as disruptions to supply chains and productivity losses. Furthermore, they may not fully account for the long-term consequences of extreme weather events, like the erosion of coastal infrastructure or the degradation of agricultural land. Overall, while economic loss estimates provide valuable insights into the financial impacts of weather- and climate-related events, it is essential to recognize their limitations and consider the broader implications for human systems and ecosystems."

            "answer": "Chemical pollution originates from various land-based and marine sources, including agriculture through the use of pesticides and veterinary medicines, industry, households, and the transport sector. Among these pollutants, persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are of significant concern due to their slow degradation and ability to bioaccumulate in the food chain. Additionally, marine litter, such as plastic bottles and packaging, breaks down into smaller particles through photodegradation, releasing chemicals like bisphenol A (BPA) and phthalates into the water. These toxic chemicals then transfer into the food chain, posing potential risks to marine life and human health. The estimation of plastic litter entering Europe's oceans is uncertain due to insufficient data."

            "question": "What are some of the major sources of plastic pollution in marine waters and how is Europe addressing this issue?",
            "answer": "Approximately 150,000 to 500,000 tonnes of plastic enter Europe's marine waters each year, with single-use plastics accounting for about 50% of all marine litter on European beaches. In response, the European Union adopted the Single Use Plastics Directive in 2019, targeting single-use plastics and fishing gear alongside other plastic products. Human-induced eutrophication, contaminant concentrations, marine litter, and noise pollution are common pressures that must be minimized for marine waters to achieve good environmental status under the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) and good ecological status for coastal waters under the Water Framework Directive (WFD). European coasts offer an increasing number of bathing sites with excellent water quality, but water quality is affected by land-based pollution from sewage, agriculture run-off, and surface run-off from coastal cities, which can carry hazardous chemicals, nutrients, and plastic litter and microplastics."

            "question": "How has the water quality of the European coastal bathing sites improved over the past decade, and what are the main factors influencing this improvement?",
            "answer": "The water quality of European coastal bathing sites has shown steady improvement since 2011, with 88.3% of these sites achieving 'excellent' water quality by 2021. The primary factors contributing to this enhancement are reductions in microbiological contamination and marine litter. Recent developments have been favorable for addressing these issues, leading to the notable progress observed in the water quality of these areas. Specifically, efforts to address microbiological contamination through wastewater treatment improvements and stricter regulations, as well as initiatives to reduce marine litter through public education campaigns and increased enforcement of littering laws, have contributed significantly to the overall improvement in European coastal water quality. Overall, these efforts have led to a healthier environment for underwater ecosystems and aquatic life."

            "answer": "The EU Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) plays a crucial role in ensuring sustainable development underwater by managing fisheries sustainably. This is accomplished through setting catch limits at the maximum sustainable yield, limiting the total amount of fish catches, and controlling who is allowed to fish, when, where, and how. These measures aim to prevent damage to vulnerable marine ecosystems and preserve fish stocks. The successful implementation of the CFP is essential for achieving the goal of ending overfishing, destructive and/or illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing practices, and reducing subsidies that encourage such activities. Unsustainable fisheries pose significant threats to marine ecosystems through the bycatch of non-target species, such as birds and cetaceans, and seabed degradation."

            "answer": "The maximum sustainable yield (MSY) value represents the largest catch that can be taken from a fish stock over an indefinite period without causing harm. To maintain sustainable fisheries, fishing mortality should not exceed this value. According to model-based median values of all F/F MSY stock assessments, fishing pressure in marine waters decreased by 37% between 2005 and 2020. In 2005, the fishing pressure was 1.87, while in 2020, it was 1.17. Values above 1.0 indicate that the current fishing mortality exceeds the estimated maximum sustainable yield. This downward trend reflects the overall decrease in overexploited fish stocks."

            "answer": "While only 27% of stocks were fished below FMSY in 2003, this figure rose to 74% in 2021. However, it's important to note that this means that a quarter of North-East Atlantic stocks were still overfished in 2021. The European Union's approach to sustainable fisheries goes beyond just adhering to MSY. The Marine Strategy Framework Directive also mandates that commercially exploited fish and shellfish populations exhibit a healthy distribution of age and size. The status of stocks and their reproductive capacity can be assessed using both fish stock biomass and spawning stock biomass. (Source: (8))"

In the case of Ireland, research indicates that this fear may be driven by factors other than actual crime rates. For example, cultural norms or historical experiences could contribute to heightened perceptions of insecurity. Consequently, while objective measures like homicide rates paint a relatively positive picture, subjective indicators reveal a different perspective on crime and safety in the country. Figures 16.2 and 16.4 illustrate this disparity. (Note: References to specific figures should be cited if necessary.)"

            "question": "What explains the difference between Ireland's low homicide death rate and high percentage of people feeling affected by crime?",
            "answer": "The difference can be attributed to the 'fear of victimisation paradox,' where population groups with low victimisation rates may still experience significant fear of crime. This phenomenon is observed in Ireland, which has a low homicide death rate but a high percentage of people reporting feelings of being affected by crime. Factors such as cultural norms or historical experiences might contribute to these heightened perceptions of insecurity. Objective measures, like homicide rates, do not fully capture the complexity of crime and safety experiences in the country. Subjective indicators provide a more nuanced understanding of the issue."

Although there has been a general decrease in female intimate partner and family-related homicides in Europe since 2010, there was an increase in the first pandemic year (2020) in some regions, particularly in western Europe. This is concerning because globally, 64% of victims of intimate partner/family-related homicides were women.

            "answer": "In the absence of a universally accepted method to evaluate the quality of justice systems, the budget allocated to law courts serves as a proxy indicator. Effective justice systems prioritize three key parameters: quality, independence, and efficiency. Judges' ability to make unbiased decisions free from government, political, or economic interference is crucial for upholding individuals' and businesses' rights. This independence ensures that the legal process remains fair and just, enabling all parties to fully exercise their legal protections. The efficiency of the justice system, meanwhile, facilitates timely resolution of disputes and reduces potential delays or backlogs, ultimately benefiting those seeking recourse through the courts. By focusing on these aspects, a justice system can effectively safeguard the rights of its citizens and foster a stable, rule-of-law environment."

This score indicates a moderate level of perceived corruption in the public sector. However, it's important to note that this score only provides a relative comparison to other countries and does not represent an absolute measure of corruption.

            "answer": "Trust in political institutions is crucial for effective democracies as it increases the likelihood of citizen participation in democratic elections and gives politicians and political parties the mandate to make decisions accepted by society. The confidence levels of three major Spanish institutions - the government, courts, and police - have fluctuated over the past two decades. This trust can significantly affect the ability of these institutions to effectively combat corruption. For instance, periods of high trust may lead to more resources being allocated towards anti-corruption efforts, while low trust could result in decreased funding or lack of support for such initiatives. Additionally, fluctuations in trust can impact public perception of the fairness and impartiality of these institutions, which can further complicate efforts to address corruption.

How does the EU aim to support Least Developed Countries (LDCs) through its ODA efforts, and what are the current and target percentages of I (Gross National Income) allocated to LDCs?",
            "answer": "Saudi Arabia and other emerging donors contributed approximately 1% of their GNI to ODA in 2021. The European Union aims to support Least Developed Countries (LDCs) by collectively providing 0.15-0.20% of I in the short term and reaching 0.20% within the 2030 Agenda. In 2021, the EU's collective official development assistance to LDCs accounted for 0.11% of I, which follows a period of stagnation around this value since 2012."

Finland also surpassed the short-term target, achieving a ratio of 0.16%. ODA (Official Development Assistance) is just one component of various financing mechanisms aimed at helping developing countries build capacity and achieve self-reliance. It can serve as a catalyst to mobilize other financial resources, including domestic tax revenues and private sector investments. Therefore, while meeting the ODA targets is essential, it represents only a part of the overall effort to support sustainable development in LDCs."

            "answer": "Governments can offer a win-win solution by implementing environmental taxes that support the transition to a climate-neutral economy. These taxes can be offset by reducing taxes in other areas, such as labor. Additionally, protecting revenue for adequate social protection is crucial. This approach is outlined in the EU's Action Plan for Fair and Sustainable Taxation. The use of behavioral taxes, like environmental and health taxes, continues to be important in 21st-century tax policies. In 2022, the general government gross debt in the EU as a percentage of GDP was 84.0%. Therefore, sustainable development through partnerships for the goals remains a priority, and the implementation of these tax policies plays a significant role in achieving this goal."
